# KonohaShurikenStore
Website of a fictional shuriken store

I am building this website to practice my CSS and SCSS skills. 
I originally made this website as one of FreeCodeCamp projects and now I am slowly improving it.
The last improvement was making an animation for the logo. 
I have also just started to make the project in SCSS instead of just CSS.

### Animation


### SCSS



### Progress
These are the goals I had in mind when I started this project:
- [x] Animation
- [ ] Adapt to SCSS
- [ ] Change classes names in a consistent way
