# konoha-shuriken-store
Website of a fictional shuriken store

I am building this website to train my CSS and SCSS skills. 
I originally made this website as one of FreeCodeCamp projects and now I am slowly improving it.
The last improvements were make an animation for the logo. 
I have also just started to make the project in SCSS instead of just CSS.
